"""
merge_logs.py file: MergeLogs class

the class responsibility is to enable the log capabilities for the instantiated model objects, and to save it into a csv
file. Because of the similarity, the logs are also saved into a plain text .txt file and printed on the console.

the second class responsibility is to take all the log output of the simulator and merge it into one unique csv file.
The merged file has to be consistent with time order.

The responsibility is achieved leveraging pandas, turning the log files into dataframes and then merging them performing
a full-outer-join.
